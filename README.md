# Economics Teaching Materials
These files are a collection of materials I have used either as a student or a Teaching Assistant (TA) throughout my studies of macroeconomics and econometrics.

Please feel free to use and share the material, and do let me know if you find any major typos or errors. Any feedback to improve the material is also welcome.
